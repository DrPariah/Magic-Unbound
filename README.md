# Magic-Unbound
A greatly expanded fantasy magic system for Cataclysm: DDA with multiple classes that have significant effects on gameplay.

For the time being there is one working class, the Novice Mage. You would load this after magiclysm to have it's spells blacklisted and overwritten by the ones in this mod, that was the quickest and easiest way to get things going, all spellbooks and scrolls should be replaced, while still giving you the benefit of magic items, monsters, locations, etc. 
Obivously I wouldn't recommend trying to play with any of the native magiclysm classes, as you won't find any spells for them in game. I'll work on it a bit more soon.
I'll adjust the starts so the mage can start in them too.

Enjoy.
